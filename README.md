## System Architecture Diagram
Here we use ROS nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following. The code was tested in a simulator, and later run on [Carla](https://medium.com/udacity/how-the-udacity-self-driving-car-works-575365270a40), the Udacity's own self-driving car. 

The following is a system architecture diagram showing the ROS nodes and topics used in the project.

## ROS Node
### Waypoint Updater node (waypoint_updater)


### Twist Controller Node (dbw_node)

### Traffic light detection node (tl_detector)

### TLClassifier class (tl_classifier)
